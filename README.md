# A Baseline Approach for AutoImplant: the MICCAI 2020 Cranial Implant Design Challenge

The gihub repository contains codes for training and testing the deep learning networks for automatic skul defect prediction described in . deep learning networks described in the codes and paper can be used as a baseline approach for the [AutoImplant](https://autoimplant.grand-challenge.org/) challenge in [MICCAI 2020](https://miccai2020.org/en/MICCAI-2020-CHALLENGES.html).

## Data
